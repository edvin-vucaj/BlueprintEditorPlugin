# Blueprint Editor
A plugin for [Frosty Editor](https://github.com/CadeEvs/FrostyToolsuite/tree/1.0.6.3) which allows assets such as LogicPrefabBlueprints and SpatialPrefabBlueprints to be edited in a proper graph form, created using [Nodify](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify).

This tool is still unfinished, with many things relating to optimization and additional support needing to be done.

## What is finished:
- Core editing features, so adding and removing connections/objects
- Node extension functionality(so connections for nodes can be mapped out)
- loading blueprints into graphed form
- layout saving
- xml style configs for node mappings
- Transient node functionality
- Layered Graph Drawing algorithm for sorting nodes
- Comment, & Redirect nodes
- Options for customizing the look and functionality of the editor
